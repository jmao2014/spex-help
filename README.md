# SPEX Help pages

This is the source code for the SPEX help pages. The full SPEX documentation can be found at 
[this page](https://spex-xray.github.io/spex-help/index.html).

## Questions and issues

If you have questions or issues with SPEX, then
please report them as an issue [here](https://github.com/spex-xray/spex-help/issues).

## Source code of help pages

These help pages are written in restructured text (rst) and they are built using Sphinx.
Please use a [recent version of Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) 
for optimal performance. To build the manual from source, the command ``make html`` should be enough 
to build the html pages in the build directory.
