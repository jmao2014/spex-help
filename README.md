# SPEX Help pages

This is the source code for the SPEX help pages. The full SPEX documentation can be found at 
[this page](https://spex-xray.github.io/spex-help/index.html).

## Questions and issues

If you have questions or issues with SPEX, then
please report them as an issue [here](https://github.com/spex-xray/spex-help/issues).

## Source code of help pages

These help pages are written in restructured text (rst) and they are built using Sphinx.
Please use the latest version of Sphinx for optimal performance. To build the manual
from source, the command ```make html``` should be enough to build the html pages in 
the build directory.
