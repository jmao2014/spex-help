Find known issues
=================

If you encounter a problem with SPEX, it is good to check whether the problem is already known.
One way to check this is, for example, entering the error message in a search engine (like
Google). This may yield articles about the SPEX problem that you have, which may point to a
solution.

It is also good to check our `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/spex-xray/spex-help/issues>`_.
The problem that you have may have been reported before (and did not end up in a search engine
yet).

If you cannot find information about your issue with SPEX, then please see the
:ref:`sec:reportissues` page to submit an issue to us. We will try to help you as quickly as
possible.
