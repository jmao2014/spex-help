Plot captions
=============

SPEX has a set of captions defined for each plot. The properties of
these captions as well as the text can be modified by the user. For the
properties (font types etc.) see :ref:`sect:plottext`.

The following captions exist:

-  ``x`` : the x-axis, plotted below the frame

-  ``y`` : the y-axis, plotted left from the frame

-  ``z`` : the z-axis (for contour plots and images), plotted at the upper
   left edge of the frame

-  ``ut`` : the upper title text, plotted in the middle above the frame

-  ``lt`` : the lower title text, plotted between the upper title text and
   the frame

-  ``id`` : the plot identification, plotted to the upper right corner of
   the frame (usually contains the  version and time and date).

With the “plot cap” series of commands, the text, appearance and
position of all these captions can be modified.
