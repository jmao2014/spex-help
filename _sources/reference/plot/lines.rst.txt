Plot line types
===============

When drawing lines, the following line types are possible:

::

  1. -----------  (Continuous line)
  2. - - - - - -  (Dashed line)
  3. .-.-.-.-.-.  (Dot-dashed line)
  4. ...........  (Dotted line)
  5. -..-..-..-.  (Dash-dotted line)

The first is the default value.

Further, the user can specify the thickness of the lines. Default value
is 1, larger values give thicker lines. Maximum value is 200.
Recommended value for papers: use line weight 3. For an example of
different line weights, see also the plot below.
